* Problem Statement: Do an end2end well annotated and commented demo of continual learning using avalanche library in colab
* Dataset: MNIST
* Explanation: Avalanche is an End-to-End Continual Learning Library (now part of the PyTorch Ecosystem!) powered by ContinualAI with the unique goal of providing a shared and collaborative open-source (MIT licensed) codebase for fast prototyping, training and reproducible evaluation of continual learning algorithms.

* Problem Statement: Colab to demonstrate active learning with lightly.ai end2end
* Dataset: Comma10k dataset
* Explanation: Active learning is a process of using model predictions to find a new set of images to annotate. The images are chosen to have a maximal impact on the model performance.

* Problem Statement: Demonstrate the use of active learning with label studio for your favorite image task
* Dataset: Webcam dataset at Jungfraujoch targeting the mountain Jungfrau in Switzerland
* Explanation: Train a classifier predicting whether a webcam targeting a mountain is showing sunny, cloudy, or very cloudy weather.
